**THIS IS A TEST VERION**

This is not for public use. But for research purposes.
ERLC calculates its code using this percentage and by RNG
but I have managed to slove it:

```

price = float(price_str.replace(",", ""))
    percentage = 0.6443
    result = price * percentage

```
_Listed above is the percentage of deduction in Dealership_
